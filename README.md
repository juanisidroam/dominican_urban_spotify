# Dominican Urban Artists Spotify Analysis #

This is a much improved version of a previous analysis I performed last year. As I've gotten more experienced with Python, I felt the need to remake it from scratch. The goal of this analysis is also of a much higher scope, as the previous version mostly dealt with trying to find the most popular artists. Here we'll try and see if we can explain why some artists or songs are more popular than others, by processing their top tracks and finding their characteristics such as tempo, rhythm, danceability, etc.

Basically, we'll try to answer the following question:
### What makes dominican urban music work? ###
